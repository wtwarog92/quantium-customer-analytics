# General Info

The main idea of this project is to analyse the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours. We are interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour.

There are 4 main tasks:

Examining transaction data – looking for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. Making the necessary changes in the dataset in case of any anomalies. 

Examining customer data – reviewing the data and merging the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the further analysis.

Data analysis and customer segments – checking total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Exploring the data, creating charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find.

Deep dive into customer segments – defining recommendation from insights, determining which segments should be a target, if packet sizes are relative and forming an overall conclusion based on analysis.
